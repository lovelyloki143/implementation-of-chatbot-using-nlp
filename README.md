problem statement:
A chatbot is a software application designed to simulate human-like conversations. They are widely used in booking tickets, answering questions, shopping online, etc. Examples: Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, MakeMyTrip bot, Swiggy Genie. How Chatbots Work: Chatbots use rules, artificial intelligence (AI), or both to process user queries and provide responses!

Methodo;ogy:
The chatbot is developed using a combination of natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. The methodology involves data preparation, model training, and chatbot response generation. The data is preprocessed to remove noise and increase training examples using synonym replacement. Multiple classification models are trained and evaluated to find the best-performing one. The trained model is then used to predict the intent of user input, and a random response is selected from the corresponding intent's responses. The chatbot is devoloped as a web application using Flask, allowing users to interact with it in real-time but yet to be deployed.

How to Use the Chatbot
You can run the Chatbot.ipynb which also includes step by step instructions in Jupyter Notebook.

objectives:
*The primary objectives of implementing chatbots include enhancing customer service, reducing operational costs, and improving user engagement. 
     *By automating responses, businesses can provide 24/7 support and gather valuable insights from user interactions, leading to better decision-making.
     *Another goal is to reduce operational costs by automating repetitive tasks and queries.
    Additionally, chatbots aim to gather data and insights to enhance user experience and improve services.

Tools and technologies:
1.Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK): is a popular Python library for processing textual data.
2.SpaCy: is another powerful library that offers fast and efficient NLP capabilities for chatbot applications.
3.Rasa provides an open-source framework specifically designed for building conversational AI.
4.Tensorflow:for building neural networks models including deeplearning based chatbots
5.Scikit-learn
6.IBM Watson assistant
